## ✅ What This Solution Does

### 1. **Agentic AI (Not Just Analytics)**

**Traditional systems:** Alert after problems occur  
**CementAI:** Prevents problems before they happen

**Flow:**
```
OT Sensors → Real-time Prediction → AI Decision → Human Approval → Autonomous Control → ROI Tracking
```

### 2. **BigQuery ML Models**

**Energy Predictor:**
- Input: 20+ process parameters
- Output: Predicted kWh/ton
- Use: Identify 5-10 kWh/ton optimization opportunities
- Accuracy: RMSE < 3 kWh/ton

**PM Risk Classifier:**
- Input: Bag filter DP, ESP load, stack temp
- Output: Probability of PM exceedance (0-1)
- Use: Prevent dust emission violations
- Accuracy: ROC-AUC > 0.94

**Quality Predictor:**
- Input: Raw chemistry, clinker temp, fuel mix
- Output: Quality flag (OK/WARNING/REJECT)
- Use: Proactive quality control
- Accuracy: 89%

### 3. **CementGPT (Fine-tuned Gemini Pro)**

**Capabilities:**
- Natural language explanations of recommendations
- Conversational plant troubleshooting
- Root cause analysis
- What-if scenario simulation

**Example:**
```
Human: "Why did energy spike at 11:15 AM?"
CementGPT: "Mill power increased from 850 to 980 kW while feed rate 
dropped from 145 to 132 tph. Cause: Mill overloading due to high 
moisture in raw material. Reduce feed rate to 125 tph."
```

### 4. **Cloud Run API Service**

**9 Production Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Health check
- `/api/v1/predict/energy` - Energy prediction
- `/api/v1/predict/pm_risk` - Dust risk prediction
- `/api/v1/recommendations` - Get AI recommendations
- `/api/v1/explain` - Generate explanations
- `/api/v1/chat` - Conversational interface
- `/api/v1/action/execute` - Execute control actions
- `/api/v1/metrics/realtime` - Live plant metrics

## 🔑 The Critical Question

Before deploying at a real plant, ask:

> **"What percentage of energy-relevant OT signals — kiln, mills, fans, stack, bag filters, utilities — are currently available in real time for AI optimization, and where are the blind spots?"**

**Why this matters:**

🟢 **≥70% coverage** → Deploy semi-autonomous in 4-6 weeks  
🟡 **50-70% coverage** → Advisor mode first, fix sensors in parallel  
🔴 **<50% coverage** → Sensor upgrade required before AI deployment  

**Signals needed:**
- Kiln inlet/outlet temps
- Preheater stage temps (1-4)
- ID/PA/SA fan speeds & power
- Mill power (raw + finish)
- Separator speed
- Bag filter DP, ESP load
- Stack temp, PM, opacity
- Feed rate, clinker temp
- Alternative fuel %
- Quality lab data
